SunPy Package Template
======================

Using the package template
--------------------------


To generate a new package from the template first install `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/>`_ then run::

  $ cookiecutter gh:sunpy/package-template


Once this will create you a new directory in your current directory named the same as the value of "packagename" you supplied.
Change into this directory and run `git init` to make it into a git repository (this is needed for it to work).
